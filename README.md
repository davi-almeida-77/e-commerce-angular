# E-Commerce Application in Angular

## Requirements to Run the Project (with Docker)

Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system:

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once installed, you can run the entire application with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davi-almeida-77/e-commerce-angular.git
cd e-commerce-angular
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```


This project was developed as part of my learning journey to master a modern web development stack. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with a range of technologies, including:

- **Angular**: To build the frontend of the e-commerce application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For implementing secure authentication and authorization between the frontend and backend.
- **Joi**: For validating user input and ensuring data integrity in the application.
- **ExpressJS**: To build the backend RESTful API that powers the e-commerce functionality.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: For enabling secure cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend during development.
- **MySQL**: As the database to store user and product data, ensuring scalability and performance.

The project focuses on creating an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The backend is responsible for handling authentication, managing product inventory, and processing orders, while the frontend in Angular provides a responsive and dynamic user interface.

One of the key learning outcomes from this project was connecting a frontend (Angular) to a backend API, ensuring smooth communication between the two through RESTful principles. By combining all these technologies, I gained valuable experience in full-stack development, as well as insights into best practices for building secure and scalable web applications.
